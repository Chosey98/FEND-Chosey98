## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. All you need is to open the `index.html` page and it will be ready to be viewed

If you want to edit any of the files then the file structure is as follow:
```
|
|
|___css
|      |
|      |
|      |_styles.css
|
|
|___js
|     |
|     |
|     |_app.js
|
|
|___index.html
|
|
|___README.md
```
You can use the `css/styles.css` to edit any styling on the page while you can use the `js/app.js` to edit the scripts used to initialize important stuff like the navbar and the active sections etc.

## Implementation

I have implmented some stuff like the navbar getting created dynamically and a function that checks which section is in view so it set's it as active and I have added also smooth scrolling to the section when navbar link clicked using `scrollIntoView` option: `behavior` set as `smooth`.
